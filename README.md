# Design and Analysis of an FPGA-based Wallace Multiplier
<br>
Project for the Bachelor's Degree thesis work in Computer Engineering: Design and analysis of an 8- and 16-bit Wallace multiplier. The hardware description was created with the help of the hardware description language VHDL and the Vivado Design Suite. Furthermore, a comparison was made with the traditional multiplier in terms of delay, resource occupation and power dissipation.<br><br>
